## 🔄 Current Issues to Address

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
The project has several TypeScript errors that need to be fixed:

1. **UI Component Import Issues**
   - Many UI components have incorrect import paths with version numbers
   - Need to clean up import statements

2. **Unused Imports**
   - Multiple components have unused React imports
   - Unused icon imports from lucide-react

3. **Type Mismatches**
   - Some component props have incorrect types
   - Missing type definitions for some parameters

4. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Some UI components reference packages not in package.json
